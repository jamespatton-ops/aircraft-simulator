# Aircraft Simulator

**A Python-based aircraft dynamics simulator** for educational purposes, demonstrating longitudinal and lateral flight behavior.

---

## Features

- Simulates aircraft longitudinal (pitch, speed) and lateral (roll, yaw) dynamics  
- Models control surface effects: elevator, aileron, rudder, and throttle  
- Visualizes key flight parameters over time (speed, pitch, roll, yaw, angles of attack and sideslip)  
- Illustrates classical dynamic modes: Phugoid, Short Period, Dutch Roll, Roll Mode, Spiral Mode
